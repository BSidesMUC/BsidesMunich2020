The “S” in IoT stands for security.
I’ve read this line so many times on blogs and on twitter, that I think it is time to do something about it.
So, how do we make an IoT product secure? Or how do we design a secure product from the start?
The answer to the last question is easy, but doing it for an existing product, that is a big challenge.
It probably can't be done in one release, but you have to start somewhere.


This talk with walk you through IoT, its components, some principles to design a secure product, the OWASP IoT Top 10 and how to address them, setting up security requirements and controls, and last but not least analyze two popular IoT use cases: a GPS tracker and smart cities irrigation system.
These should lay a fertile ground for further discussion.

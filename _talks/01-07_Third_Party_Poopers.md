Supply chain attacks are becoming increasingly widespread as cyber criminals seek to access sensitive data and systems through less secure third parties. 
In such attacks, the victim is not the ultimate target of the attack, but rather a stepping stone to other larger networks. 
In this talk, I will present an overview of supply chain attacks and delve into various attack patterns, specific cases, lessons learned, challenges and mitigations.

### Outline

 - Who I Am - In infosec around 2003, various positions (CISO, researcher, pen tester, consultant with true love to low level and hardware hacking).
 - Recap of supply chain and 3rd party compromises - what is the defined problem, why we care, challenges.
 - Attack patterns, Categories, such as:
   * Source Code Repository & compromise 
   * Watering hole attack.
   * Build, source and publishing infrastructure.
   * Fake Toolchain.
   * Backdooring SDK.
   * Typo Squatting.
   * More complicated cases.

We will go over and mention cases such as: PEAR Breach, Komodo, ShadowHammer, HandBrake, CCleanup and others.

 - Mitigations and lessons learned.
 - Closer and Q&A
